            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Mirisa and I'm a very enthusiastic self tought front-end developer.
            I made the decision to learn coding because I've always been passionate about learning coding. 
            After more than 5 years of working as a human resources specialist, I decided to learn coding myself through Codecademy and Udemy, from which I learned a lot. 
            For me, commitment, attitude and continuity to learn are the most important things that enable us to move forward with determination. 
            I like the fact that in this profession there is always something new to learn as I am a person who constantly wants to achive new skills.
            I have a passion for building beautiful websites using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.
            I am seeking opportunities to grow more and more in this profession and to create modern and unique websites based on your demands.</p>
