*About Me*

-----

Hey there, I'm Mirisa and I'm a very enthusiastic, self-taught front-end developer. 
Having had always a passion for programming, I decided to become a front-end developer. 
After working as a human resources specialist for more than five years, I made the decision 
to learn coding on Codecademy and Udemy, where I have learned a great deal. 
The things that were key for me to continue were commitment, attitude focused and continuity
 in my learning process. Personally, I like the fact that there is always something new to learn in this field, 
as I tend to be a person who wants to keep acquiring new skills. 
I am looking forwards for opportunities to create a career as a web developer and i would 
really welcome a chance to collaborate with your company.
